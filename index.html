  <h1>What is CentroUI?</h1>

  <p>
    CentroUI provides a set of reusable and extendable UI controls for building interfaces for WebVR applications. This library is based on ReactVR, providing developers with text input controls, cards, lists, navigation items and grids, all built with cross-device and cross-browser compatibility to ensure consistent experience with any environment and device.

    The layout engine intelligently places elements depending on context, providing a predictable and structured approach to building interfaces for WebVR.

    The UI elements are built according to best practices for building UI for VR and come with capabilities for zooming and highlighting to ensure the best user experience at the lowest development cost.
